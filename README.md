A classic Pong game implementation in Python using the Turtle graphics library. This two-player game recreates the iconic table tennis-style gameplay where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3.10
- **Graphics:** Turtle Graphics Library
- **Dependencies:** No external dependencies required (uses Python's built-in libraries)

## 🕹️ Gameplay Features

- **Two-Player Mode**
  - Left player uses 'W' and 'S' keys
  - Right player uses Up and Down arrow keys
  - Real-time score tracking

- **Game Elements**
  - Smooth paddle movement
  - Dynamic ball physics
  - Score display
  - Collision detection
  - Classic retro styling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
